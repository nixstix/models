1 factors were found to explain no variance and they were removed for downstream analysis. You can disable this option by setting load_model(..., remove_inactive_factors = FALSE)
Warning message:
In .quality_control(object, verbose = verbose) :
  Factor(s) 1 are strongly correlated with the total number of expressed features for at least one of your omics. Such factors appear when there are differences in the total 'levels' between your samples, *sometimes* because of poor normalisation in the preprocessing steps.
